# offspring-simulation-of-population-migration
imulate two populations with migration each other
Task: Simulate two populations, each of which has n individual observations and m variables, where you specify the values of n and m at the start of the simulation.
Each of the variables will start with 2 possible categories, which you can label as 0 and 1. 


 there are two sexes of individuals, M and F. When breeding the population, each child must have one M parent and one F parent. The child will be M or F randomly with 50% probability for each

  two populations have some migration between them. In other words, at each generation a specified proportion M of the parents will be selected from the other population instead of this population
